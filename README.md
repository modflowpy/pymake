This is a relatively simple python package for compiling MODFLOW-based programs.
The package determines the build order using a directed acyclic graph and then
compiles the source files using gfortran or intel Fortran (ifort).

pymake can be run from the command line or it can be called from within python.

pymake includes example scripts for building MODFLOW 6, MODFLOW-2005, MODFLOW-NWT,
MODFLOW-USG, MODFLOW-LGR, MODFLOW-2000, MODPATH 6, MODPATH 7, MT3DMS, MT3D-USGS,
and SEAWAT using gfortran on Mac or Linux.  The scripts download the distribution
file from the USGS and compile the source into a binary executable.

pymake includes code for compiling with ifort on Windows and OSX.

Note that if gfortran is used, the `openspec.f` and `FILESPEC.inc` (MT3DMS)
file will automatically be changed to the following so that binary files are
created properly using standard Fortran:

```
c -- created by pymake.py
CHARACTER*20 ACCESS,FORM,ACTION(2)
DATA ACCESS/'STREAM'/
DATA FORM/'UNFORMATTED'/
DATA (ACTION(I),I=1,2)/'READ','READWRITE'/
c -- end of include file
```

## Command Line Usage

To see help for running from command line, use the following statement.

```python -m pymake.pymake -h```

usage: ```pymake.py [-h] [-fc {ifort,gfortran}] [-cc {gcc,clang}]
[-ar {ia32,ia32_intel64,intel64}] [-mc] [-dbl] [-dbg] [-e]
[-dr] [-sd] [-ff]
srcdir target```

This is the pymake program for compiling fortran source files, such as the
source files that come with MODFLOW. The program works by building a directed
acyclic graph of the module dependencies and then compiling the source files
in the proper order.

positional arguments:
srcdir                Location of source directory
target                Name of target to create

optional arguments:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-fc {ifort,gfortran}  Fortran compiler to use (default is gfortran)
-cc {gcc,clang}       C compiler to use (default is gcc)
-ar {ia32,ia32_intel64,intel64}
Architecture to use for ifort (default is intel64)
-mc, --makeclean      Clean files when done
-dbl, --double        Force double precision
-dbg, --debug         Create debug version
-e, --expedite        Only compile out of date source files. Clean must not
have been used on previous build. Does not work yet
for ifort.
-dr, --dryrun         Do not actually compile. Files will be deleted, if
--makeclean is used. Does not work yet for ifort.
-sd, --subdirs        Include source files in srcdir subdirectories.
-ff, --fflags         Additional fortran compiler flags.
-mf, --makefile       Create a standard makefile. Does not work for
ifort for Windows yet.

Note that the source directory should not contain any bad or duplicate source
files as all source files in the source directory will be built and linked.


## From Python

### Script to compile mfnwt

import pymake
srcdir = '../mfnwt/src'
target = 'mfnwt'
pymake.main(srcdir, target, 'gfortran', 'gcc', makeclean=True, expedite=False,
dryrun=False, double=False, debug=False, include_subdirs=False)

*or see make_mfnwt.py in examples directory*


## Automatic Download and Build

The following scripts can be run directly from the command line to build
MODFLOW 6, MODFLOW-2005, MODFLOW-NWT, MODFLOW-USG, MODFLOW-LGR,
MODFLOW-2000, MODPATH 6, MODPATH 7, MT3DMS, MT3D-USGS, and SEAWAT
binaries on Mac and Linux. The scripts will download the distribution
file from the USGS (requires internet connection), unzip the file, and
compile the source.  MT3DMS will be downloaded from the University of
Alabama.

python make_modflow6.py
python make_mf2005.py
