# Getting Started
Pymake can be used directly from the command line and within a python script. 
Examples of both use cases are given below. 

## Command Line Usage

pymake can be used to compile MODFLOW 6 directly from the command line using 
the Intel Fortran compiler `ifort` from a subdirectory at the same level as 
the `src` subdirectory by specifying:

```
python -m pymake ../src/ ../bin/mf6 -mc --subdirs -fc ifort
```

To see help for running from command line, use the following statement.

```
python -m pymake -h
```

The help message identifies required positional arguments and optional 
arguments that can be provided to overide default values.

```
usage: __main__.py [-h] [-fc {ifort,mpiifort,gfortran,none}]
                    [-cc {gcc,clang,clang++,icc,icl,mpiicc,g++,cl,none}]
                    [-ar {ia32,ia32_intel64,intel64}] [-mc] [-dbl] [-dbg] [-e]
                    [-dr] [-sd] [-ff FFLAGS] [-cf CFLAGS] [-sl {-lc,-lm}] [-mf]
                    [-cs COMMONSRC] [-ef EXTRAFILES] [-exf EXCLUDEFILES] [-so]
                    [-ad APPDIR] [-v] [--keep] [--zip ZIP] [--inplace]
                    srcdir target

This is the pymake program for compiling fortran, c, and c++ source files,
such as the source files that come with MODFLOW. The program works by building
a directed acyclic graph of the module dependencies and then compiling the
source files in the proper order.

positional arguments:
  srcdir                Path source directory.
  target                Name of target to create. (can include path)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -fc {ifort,mpiifort,gfortran,none}
                        Fortran compiler to use. (default is gfortran)
  -cc {gcc,clang,clang++,icc,icl,mpiicc,g++,cl,none}
                        C/C++ compiler to use. (default is gcc)

                        have been used on previous build. (default is False)
  -dr, --dryrun         Do not actually compile. Files will be deleted, if
                        --makeclean is used. Does not work yet for ifort.

                        (default is None)
  -ff FFLAGS, --fflags FFLAGS
                        Additional Fortran compiler flags. Fortran compiler
                        flags should be enclosed in quotes and start with a
                        blank space or separated from the name (-ff or
                        --fflags) with a equal sign (-ff='-O3'). (default is

  -cf CFLAGS, --cflags CFLAGS
                        Additional C/C++ compiler flags. C/C++ compiler flags
                        should be enclosed in quotes and start with a blank
                        space or separated from the name (-cf or --cflags)
                        with a equal sign (-cf='-O3'). (default is None)
  -sl {-lc,-lm}, --syslibs {-lc,-lm}
                        Linker system libraries. Linker libraries should be
                        enclosed in quotes and start with a blank space or
                        separated from the name (-sl or --syslibs) with a

  -ef EXTRAFILES, --extrafiles EXTRAFILES
                        List of extra source files to include in the
                        compilation. extrafiles can be either a list of files
                        or the name of a text file that contains a list of
                        files. (default is None)
  -exf EXCLUDEFILES, --excludefiles EXCLUDEFILES
                        List of extra source files to exclude from the
                        compilation. excludefiles can be either a list of
                        files or the name of a text file that contains a list
                        of files. (default is None)
  -so, --sharedobject   Create shared object or dll on Windows. (default is
                        False)
  -ad APPDIR, --appdir APPDIR
                        Target path that overides path defined target path
                        (default is None)
  -v, --verbose         Verbose output to terminal. (default is False)
  --keep                Keep existing executable. (default is False)
  --zip ZIP             Zip built executable. (default is False)
  --inplace             Source files in srcdir are used directly. (default is
                        False)

Note that the source directory should not contain any bad or duplicate source
files as all source files in the source directory, the common source file
directory (srcdir2), and the extra files (extrafiles) will be built and
linked. Files can be excluded by using the excludefiles command line switch.
```

Note that command line arguments for Fortran flags, C/C++ flags, and syslib 
libraries should be enclosed in quotes and start with a space prior to the 
first value (`-ff ' -O3'`) or use an equal sign separating the command line 
argument and the values (`-ff='-O3'`). The command line argument to use an 
`-O3` optimization level when compiling MODFLOW 6 with the `ifort` compiler 
would be:

```
python -m pymake ../src/ ../bin/mf6 -mc --subdirs -fc ifort -ff='-O3'
```

## From Python

### Script to compile MODFLOW 6

When using the pymake object (`Pymake()`) only the positional arguments 
(`srcdir`, `target`) need to be specified in the script. 

```python
import pymake
pm = pymake.Pymake()
pm.srcdir = '../mfnwt/src'
pm.target = 'mf6'
pm.include_subdirs = True
pm.build()
```

It is suggested that optional variables required for successful compiling and 
linking be manually specified in the script to mininimize the potential for 
unsuccessful builds. For MODFLOW 6, subdirectories in the `src` subdirectory
need to be included and '`pm.include_subdirs = True`' has been specified in
the script. Custom optimization levels and compiler flags could be specified
to get consistent builds. 

Non-default values for the optional arguments can specified as command line 
arguments. For example, MODFLOW 6 could be compiled using Intel compilers 
instead of the default GNU compilers with the script listed above by 
specifying:

```
python mymf6script.py -fc ifort -cc icc
```

## Notes
If gfortran is used to compile MODFLOW-based codes, the `openspec.f` 
and `FILESPEC.inc` (MT3DMS) files will automatically be changed to the 
following so that binary files are created properly using standard Fortran:

```
c -- created by pymake.py
CHARACTER*20 ACCESS,FORM,ACTION(2)
DATA ACCESS/'STREAM'/
DATA FORM/'UNFORMATTED'/
DATA (ACTION(I),I=1,2)/'READ','READWRITE'/
c -- end of include file
```

Use of `STREAM` access does not delete an existing unformatted file before 
opening it for writing. As a result, data from previous runs may exist in the 
file if the model is run for a shorter period of time. This does not apply to 
MODFLOW 6 simulations.
